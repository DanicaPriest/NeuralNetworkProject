# Rabbit Name Database
Users can either manually add a rabbit name to the database or add 100 random rabbit names collected from the Petfinder API. Application uses basic OATH and requires a users database to store the username and encrypted password. 

*at the moment the petfinder api is down for EU users. I'm working on a replacement api and will update the application.
